# Quill composer for NodeBB

This plugin activates the WYSIWYG Quill composer for NodeBB. Please ensure that:

* The markdown plugin is disabled
* Any other composers (i.e. nodebb-plugin-composer-default) are disabled
* **Warning** This composer saves its data in a unique format that is only compatible with Quill. You'll have to use the
  bundled importer/exporter to convert existing posts if necessary.

## Contributors Welcome
This plugin is in its early stages. If you'd like to look at the [documentation](https://quilljs.com/docs/) and add a feature, or take a look at the GitHub Issues and do something from there then please do. All pull requests lovingly reviewed.
