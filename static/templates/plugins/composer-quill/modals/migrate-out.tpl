<p class="lead">Use this utility to reverse any previously migrated content back to its old format</p>
<p>
	If there were posts that were migrated <strong>to</strong> Quill via the bundled utility, a backup of the old content was saved. This migrator will restore the old format. Any posts made in Quill will be left as-is.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Important!</strong> &rarr; Once begun, the migration process cannot be stopped.
